# Phase 3 – Todo AI Chatbot 🤖📝

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository represents **Phase 3** of the **Todo Evolution Project**, developed as part of a hackathon. Each phase of this project is maintained in a **separate GitHub repository** to clearly demonstrate architectural and feature-wise evolution for judges and reviewers.
